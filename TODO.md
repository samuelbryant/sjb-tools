# Short Term

1. Add concept of "priority" to TODO items

2. Add tags to TODO items

3. Add script to print TODOs at start of bash session

4. Add project linting.

5. Object handling refactor: There needs to be a simple point of object conversion and validation between json load and object initialization. This way it will be clear where changes are made. Do not do any validation or parsing in the constructors (or do all of it that way)
