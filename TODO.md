# Short Term

4. Update show to filter by completed, tags, and priority

5. Add script to print TODOs at start of bash session

7. Object handling refactor: There needs to be a simple point of object conversion and validation between json load and object initialization. This way it will be clear where changes are made. Do not do any validation or parsing in the constructors (or do all of it that way)

8. Add automatic json file backups

9. Add malformed json file handling
